Then, when we want to make changes, we create a branch, make the changes there, then `merge` them back into the main branch, here is a visualisation of that process graphically from a nice [tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches#:~:text=The%20git%20branch%20command%20lets,checkout%20and%20git%20merge%20commands.)\n",

Perhaps the most important is to **ensure that each commit performs one logical change**. Avoid making lots and lots of changes, then committing them all together. This might seem natural. For example, you may previously have dumped all your code into Dropbox at the end of each day. But, it renders the `git log` useless and makes merging your code really hard! \n",

    "`git` itself is software to track changes to a set of files (i.e our software). However, as we have seen above, lots of packages are developed openly on platforms like GitHub. At it's core, GitHub provides a place to share your git repository with others (and find and clone their repositories). But, beyond this GitHub and similar platforms have developed a way of working with git repositories which is often referred to as **GitHub Flow**. In short, this describes the *flow* of software development from an idea to part of the published package. You can read about [github flow here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow). (Note that other platforms have names like GitLab flow and some of the concepts are renames, e.g. Pull Request == Merge Request. Here we will use the GitHub terminology)."
