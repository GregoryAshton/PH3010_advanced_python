    "    return {'x': x, 'y': y}\n",
    "```\n",
    "2. **One statement per line**: This code is messy and **hard to read**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print('one'); print('two')\n",
    "if x == 1: print('one')\n",
    "if <complex comparison> and <other complex comparison>:\n",
    "    # do something\n",

    "cond2 = <other complex comparison>\n",
    "if cond1 and cond2:\n",
    "    # do something\n",
    "```\n",
    "3. **Use a linter**. A linter is a tool to automatically check your code conforms to some standard tests. One is already included in the template package above called `flake8`. You may well see your code fail due to this, you should fix the errors.\n",
    "4. **[Dont Repeat Yourself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)**. If you find yourself copy/pasting a snippet to do the same job twice, refactor your software so you can reuse the code. \n",
    "5. All functions and methods of classes should have a docstring. They should be named descriptively. Classes should use PascalCase (i.e. `MyNewClass`) while functions should use snake_case (i.e. `my_function`). Constants should be in all-caps snake case (`SOLAR_MASS=2e30`) while variables should be lower snake case (i.e. `my_variable=1`)\n",
    "6. Functions, classes, and modules should all contain a single logical idea. Break up monolithic objects into smaller more manageable pieces. As a rough rule of thumb, functions should only accept 2-3 positional arguments and 4-5 keyword arguments. Similarly with the `__init__` method of classes. And, a module should only be a few hundred lines long - any longer than this and you should refactor into several modules."
